7x1199_FriezeOpt.xyz (6.3 MB) Contains atomic coordinates (in Å) of 8393 RMQ1D materials (7 Frieze groups, 11 Metals, 109 Rings). The geometries were optimized for the Cu systems.

7x1199_P1subgroup.xyz (8.4 MB) Contains atomic coordinates (in Å) of 8393 RMQ1D materials. Geometries of the larger 6 frieze groups were constructed with the P1 geometries placed at Wyckoff positions.

7x1199_PBE0_AtmE.dat (137 kB) Contains PBE0 atomization energies per-formula-unit per-atom (in eV/atom) for 8393 RMQ1D materials. Energies were calculated in a single point fashion on 7x1199_FriezeOpt.xyz (PBE geometries).

7x1199_fingerprint.dat (4.9 MB) Contains Wyckoff-encoded fingerprint vectors for 8393 RMQ1D materials.
